## Why Lukehog?

When you're shipping a lot of small Flutter projects it is cumbersome to deal with existing analytics providers. They don't work on all target platforms, the admin panels have too many features, setting up each project takes a bit of time, and it can be very difficult to get your data back out. All of this takes away from what really matters, building software for real people and understanding the impact.

If you want something simple that JustWorksâ„¢, Lukehog is for you.

## Strategy

Keep your analytics names simple, explicit, and track only the most critical events. You'll be surprised at how effective a strategy this is for getting product analytics.

When in doubt, focus on metrics that reveal "feature uses".

## TODO
